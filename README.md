Lecture notes for the Fall 2017 iteration.

## Overview of Course Topics

Throughout this course we will cover (and utilize within the context of ongoing projects) a variety of topics, concepts, and techniques. A rough enumeration is provided below.

* Design, development and implementation
  * Identification and assembly of requirements
  * Researching existing libraries, frameworks, and components
    * Choosing an appropriate license
    * Identifying open source components
      * Back-end/server-side
        * Registration/authentication
        * Storage and security
      * Front-end/client-side
        * Paradigms (e.g., MVC)
        * Frameworks
        * Platforms/environments and compatibility
  * Selection of development stack and tools
  * Specification
  * Project management
    * Planning
    * Lifecycle/workflow/team organization paradigms
      * Agile/scrum
  * Documentation
* Evaluation
  * Testing
  * Validation
  * Verification
  * Usability testing (think-aloud, alpha, beta)
  * Continuous integration
* Deployment
  * Adding to open source repositories
  * Posting on content distribution networks
  * Release planning
  * Staging and production environments
  * Phases (alpha, beta, etc.)
  * Continuous deployment
* Maintenance
  * Dependencies and compatibility
  * Updates
  * Feature requests

## Feasibility, Requirements, and Use Cases

* Feasibility
  * Usability
  * Architecture
  * Data
  * Security
  * Maintenance

* Functional requirements
  * **Gathering**: Discuss with the client and end users (or collect via surveys, questionnaires, and so on) to understan their expectations of the software artifact(s) to be built.
  * **Organizing**: Prioritize and arrange the requirements in order of importance, urgency, and convenience.
  * **Negotiation and discussion**: If requirements are ambiguous or there are some conflicts in requirements of various stakeholders, it is then negotiated and discussed with stakeholders. Requirements may then be prioritized and reasonably compromised.
  * **Documentation**: All formal & informal, functional and non-functional requirements are documented and made available for review.

* Non-functional requirements
  * Logging
  * Storage
  * Configuration
  * Performance
  * Cost
  * Interoperability: does it need to work with other services or frameworks
  * Flexibility
  * Accessibility
  * Security
  * Disaster recovery

* Use cases
  * General characteristics
    * As detailed as possible
    * Not the same as design criteria
    * Concrete actors and actions
    * Rich scenarios (skill level, motivation, condition)
    * Not likely to be exhaustive
    * Preferably few in number
  * Some links of interest
